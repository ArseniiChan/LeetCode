# LeetCode

Algorithm and data structure practice in **Python** with documented solutions and patterns for long-term problem-solving improvement.

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills through consistent practice.
- Learn and apply algorithmic patterns instead of memorizing solutions.
- Build confidence for technical interviews and real-world problem solving.
- Track growth and reflections over time.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **LeetCode-75/** → Solutions to the curated *LeetCode 75* problems, organized by topic.  
- **notes/** → Topic-based study notes (arrays, DP, graphs, etc.).  
- **reflections/** → Daily/weekly reflections and learnings.  
- **PROJECT.md** → Detailed project plan, including the UMPIRE problem-solving method.  
- **LeetCode-75.md** → Checklist for tracking progress across the 75 problems.  

## 🛠️ Approach
- Solve problems using the **UMPIRE method**:  
  - **U**nderstand → read and clarify the problem.  
  - **M**atch → relate to known problem patterns.  
  - **P**lan → outline an approach before coding.  
  - **I**mplement → write clean, well-documented code.  
  - **R**eview → check correctness and complexity.  
  - **E**valuate → reflect on improvements and alternatives.  

- If I get stuck:
  1. Revisit fundamentals or review the topic.  
  2. Use hints sparingly.  
  3. Document what I learned before moving forward.
